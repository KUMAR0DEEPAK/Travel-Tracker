Travel Tracker
A full-stack web application that allows users to log and visualize countries they've visited. Built with **Express.js**, **EJS**, and **PostgreSQL**, this project emphasizes clean UI, robust backend integration, and user-specific data tracking.

How It Works
- Users can add countries via a form
- Backend validates entries and stores them in a PostgreSQL database
- UI updates dynamically to reflect total countries visited
- Error messages are displayed inline for better user experience

Future Enhancements
- Interactive map visualization of visited countries
- Color-coded entries based on user preferences
- Tooltip-based UI improvements for better accessibility
